# Game-Trainer

The Game Trainer is the implementation of my personal project which I entitle "Semi-Supervised Q-Learning in a 2-Player Board Game." It is a platform-independent artificial-intelligence algorithm that learns  to play tic-tac-toe or other 2-token board games from a partly-randomised analytical opponent.

## Status
The source code is currently implemented using the Qt platform but the classes that perform the analytical and the machine-learning are intended to be platform-independent. I'm currently still working on the early machine-learning portion and it will be uploaded in early April 2018. Meanwhile, the user interface and semi-random analytical opponent compile and work well.

## Environment
I've compiled this using Qt Creator 4.5.1 (Based on Qt 5.10.1) and compiling using MSVC 2015, 64-bits on x86. Even though I haven't yet much effort on portability at this early stage of the implementation, your comments on any portability issues you encounter are most welcome.
